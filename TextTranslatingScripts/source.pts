Before the price evaluation program, AutoScout24 had used predictive analytics primarily for internal decision making and looking to answer questions based on historical data.

But now, with the price evaluation tool we needed a prediction model that would be continuously integrated into live operations. This posed a significant challenges for our data science team: we needed to ensure that the system could handle performance requirements, without needing manual performance optimization or sacrificing prediction accuracy.

To achieve that result, we realized there was an opportunity to take a Continuous Delivery approach to predictive analytics. Typically, concepts such as Continuous Delivery, Test-Driven Development and Consumer-Driven Contracts are increasingly common in software engineering. They’re almost unheard of in data science practice.
