# Text to speech tool

Why do we use this? We can use this to transform the TXT files to speech. For example. We get a TXT e-book and feel happy, because we may open a brand-new world. But we may not want to read it on screen, because our eyes are sore or we may read something else. In such case transform the text to speech will be helpful for us.
